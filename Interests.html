<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<h4> Since young I was interested in the field of philosophy from the pre Socratics, the stoics, the Socratics, metaphysics, and existentialism.
     These fields have served me to open my thoughts to fallacies in myself and the world, to try to see the world as what is not what I want it to be. It just serves as a tool to adjust my senses.</h4>

<div class="column">
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<h4> Being brought up with a mom who is a fine dining chef has come with the benefit of trying a plethora of foods which has developed into an obsession of trying to re-produce
     the things that I have tasted in abroad or as food experiments with for example fermentation.</h4>
</div>

        
<div class="column">
<h3>Literature</h3>
<h4> Growing up dyslexic made me have a deep despise in books for many years but when I started learning about the benefits and the beautiful things humanity has written I was convinced to start. 
    We all get socialized by our parents, grandparents, and teachers. I believe reading is a second chance, not about being born again, but growing up a second time as your won educator and guide. My reading habits include anything and everything interesting .</h4>

<div class="column">
<h3>History</h3>
<h4> Never found that school history marketed history as an interesting and diverse subject, it was always about world war 1 and 2, but after getting my hands in some history books I’ve found the subject so was and it has taught me how the past affects the present in far more ways that one can image. 
</h4> </div>
  
<div class="column">
<h3>Microscopy</h3>
<h4> Recent hobby that started a few years ago, it all started when watching the YouTube channel “journey to the microcosm”, sparked my joy to collect and analyse different microfauna to learn more about the world which is not horizon..</h4>
